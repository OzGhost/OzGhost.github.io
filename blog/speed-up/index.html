        <h1>Multi-thread</h1>
        <h3>
            What in the world is it?
        </h3>
        <p>Sorry but JavaScript have nothing to do with multi-thread</p>
        <p>
        Think about it like you have dish to prepare. But instead of prepare it yourself, you have someone lend you a hand.
        The dish will be complete in a shorter period of time when you do it alone
        </p>

        <p>
        In short, you do several stuff simultaneously by running those stuff in several thread instead of run it one by one sequentially 
        </p>
        <h3>
            How can it help?
        </h3>
        <p>
        It's almost obvious that multi-thread make things faster
        </p>
        <p>
        For example you have a unit of work that include two separate task says, A and B:
            <ul>
                <li>Required time <b>sequentially</b> run = time(A) + time(B)</li>
                <li>Required time <b>simultaneously</b> run = max( time(A), time(B) )</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        So the best we can get out of it is to reduce the required time by a half (when A and B take the same amount of time to run)
        </p>
        <h3>
            But. Nothing come for free
        </h3>
        <p>
        There are several issue you need to solve before jumping in and turn a block of normal code to multi-thread code

                        <b>Locking</b>: using <i>synchronizes</i> keyword to perform locking. It cost time to acquite a lock.
                        Sometime the lock be hold for a long period (like loop through a huge list) then it block others thread that need access to that list.
                        Beside, you need to decide the lock level for each lock (class based or instance based).
                        And be careful cause there is a chance for deadlock every time you using locking.
                        <b>Tip:</b> turn check-then-act series to atomic operation by locking

                        So, consider to build immutable shared resource over locking if possible

                Cancellation or Interuption react may become useful that save system resource. For exam, after hit a button to perform a complex calculation,
                User decide to stop it by hit cancel so the application need a mechanism to stop the calculate thead. Otherwise, the calculate thread will
                run wild until the calculation complete or exception occur

                may silently fade away without anyone noticed. So in multi-thread environment, exception need extra care too.

                The cost to creat and manage threads maybe far greater than the cost to make your work done. So take time to decide that to create thread
                time by time or maintain an amount of thread then feed them with work. In case, you make a thread living around so another problem is
                when to stop that thread and if they stopped unexpectly which stratergy to renew them?

                Split the work:
                <img src="work_splitting.png" style="width: 300px"/><br/>
                Try to split a single unit of work to multiple independence tasks. That mean each task can be perform separately from others
                as soon as the input for it become ready. Split work by nature is a good place to start...
            </li>
            <li>
                Decide which to share: Producer-Consumer like system need a common queue to put/take. Observer like system need a common flag to watch on v.v...
                So point out which resource that must be shared among the thread and strategy to manipulate them
            </li>
            <li>
                Design exception handling mechanism: Definitely you don't want any exception silently leak out of the system so spend time for this topic
            </li>
            <li>
                Design cancellation/interruption mechanism: very nice to have
            </li>
            <li>
                Design the thread creation/maintenance mechanism: You can build your own thread pool or rely on library/language support
                or whatever meet your need. And you may need to answer the question about 'How many thread is enough?` when build or use a pool

        In case, the cache store in higher speed access storage then the access time will be reduce</p>

        <p>gRPC is a RPC framework</p>
        <h3>How can it help?</h3>
        <p>The payload size for each call will be smaller -&gt; reduce the time that tranfer payload over network</p>

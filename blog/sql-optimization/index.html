                Feeling slow with your SQL query?
            </small>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            You wrote an SQL query. Then executed it.
            Then waited for it ... and saw the result. That was <b>OK</b>.<br>
            But, maybe user who uses your product
            will not seem that's <i>'OK'</i>.<br>
            In that case, of course, you need to speed it up,
            or your boss will ask you to do that.
        </p>
        <h2>Is it really necessary?</h2>
        <p>
            Almost all projects that I made at university and even
            projects which I was joined in my company.
            There is almost every SQL query which looked like very simple,
            was used.<br>
            About 50 percents of them do the job like <i>Create</i>
            or <i>Modify</i> or <i>Delete</i> some record. This kind of query
            will not take a long time to wait for.<br>
            The rest was used for retrieving data. In the regular case,
            these queries sometimes look like a little bit slower than another
            but still acceptable.<br>
            So, what is optimizing for?
        </p>
        <h2>How about my case?</h2>
        <p>
            A normal day in the past, I came to my office like another day
            and my team leader said to me:
            <i>"Hey guy, I wonder why this function was too slow.
            Can you improve it?"</i><br>
            Thirty minutes later, I found the reason. That function retrieved data
            from a table with about thirty million records inside.<br>
            Have you felt like a huge table yet? @@
        </p>
        <h2>That's why ...</h2>
        <p>
            In some case, maybe rare cases, you work with a <i>'huge table'</i>
            but you didn't notice about the out-of-size of this table.
            Then you create queries like you did. They work properly but
            few of them seem slow or even very slow.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my case, someone else wrote the function a year ago. At that time,
            maybe that table not big enough to drag the whole function slows down.
            But now, it was. Unfortunately, that guy had left the team a long time ago
            and now I am maintaining his function.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem ...</h2>
        <p>
            With few simple query, I found that the table has more than thirty
            million records. And the target query with where clause covers about six
            million records. Beside it, the query requires a function max to retrieve
            the newest records which were inserted into the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mention the function max here because it causes a problem. When you
            use any 'group by' function like <i>Count</i> or <i>Sum</i> or
            <i>Average</i> ... on a non-index column, it requests database management
            system (DBMS) scan through all records satisfy where clause to calculate
            the final result.
        </p>
        <p>
            One more problem here is function max was used on time stamp column.
            That's mean, compare operation has to work on date data type and
            if you were tried it before, you will know it takes a bunch of time,
            much more than comparing numeric data type.
        </p>
        <h2>Solution ???</h2>
        <p>
             You can do nothing to reduce table size. Data was saved down for some
             reason, is not the thing you can freely remove without permission
             (except testing data). The thing you can do is face the size no matter
             how big it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, the data of this table have a special property
            can be tricked. That property is a relation between time stamp column was
            used to compare and identified column which increases automatic.
            That's mean, function max use on time stamp column or identified
            column give the same result. In addition, in my case, identified colum
            is a numeric column.
            <br>
            With this trick, I solve the data type problem. How about the last one?
        </p>
        <p>
            If you know well about the index in a relational database system. You will see
            the last problem about scan through a large number of records was solve
            with about trick. I read it somewhere on the internet that when cause
            function min on an indexed column, DBMS just need to return record matches
            the first index. So, I think if we use function max instead of min
            function, DBMS do the same thing with the last index.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about DBMS's index like an array index.
            If you have an index, you can immediately access your array item data
            with this index. So, when an index was specified, DBMS can immediately
            return the record denote by this index. Finding first or the last index
            is not too difficult to.
        </p>
        <p>
            With above trick, the function much faster than before. Now it takes
            total six hundred millisecond instead of twenty seconds with the old query.
        </p>
        <p>
            Few date later, my department leader ask me to support another team
            run in the same trouble like this. I do the same trick and receive
            the same result.<br>
            If you're in my case, let try it. This trick really cool at all.

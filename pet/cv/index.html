          <h3>Introduce</h3>
            Hi, I'm Duc, an ordinary guy with an ordinary life. I code for fun but
            when coding become not fun I watch anime, which was dubed in English,
            to have fun instead. <br/>
            I read programmming books sometimes, try to build up
            the knowledge of mine.
            Then find the way to apply them into my code. <br/>
            I quite interest about performance and try my best to make everything
            go as fast as possible while still keep it clear enough to understand.

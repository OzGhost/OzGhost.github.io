            <h3>Short</h3>
            I have been using Linux for years therefore I am able to operate at full power with it.<br/>
            By any chance that I have to work on Windows or MacOS then you can expect to lose about 40% of my strength and speed.<br/>
            I can work well in both English and Vietnamese but prefer English environment.<br/>
            In my point of view, work is where the fun come from so please don't make my work become too messy.

            The UI which designed by other team and got customer approval on prototype - will be implement by our team.
            The UI support two famous browser which is Firefox and Chrome. The responsive layout can display well on many devices.

            if it possible to improve anything. Later on, I help re-write an query on huge table which take minutes to complete down to seconds.
